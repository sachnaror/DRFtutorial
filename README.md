Well, its about Django REST Framework  – so i deviced it like: "Feel Blessed!! ‘Coz Boss wants you to REST".

Sounds rythymic ? Well ,well, well.

Tried after a long time to build a REST API in Django through a very simple method. I followed minimal steps to get going with minimum code.

Django REST Framework (DRF) allows to rapidly build RESTful APIs.

- Django for APIs
- RESTful web services and then
- Build up to DRF.


## More on DRF

DRF sits on top of Django. It is not a separate framework. You can say that it is a tool which alongside Django is used to develop RESTful APIs. It increases the development speed. It also addresses various security issues natively 9will talk about this in other repos on my Github).

DRF is an Open Source Software, just like Django.

The documentation of DRF is actually considered better than Django’s. The only catch is that we need to have a bit of previous knowledge to understand the DRF documentation. Django is, of course, the prerequisite but also some basic knowledge of REST is necessary.

## What’s DRF doing here?


At one time, for a moment, I asked from myself that what’s the role of DRF. All this could have been achieved by Django Admin if I wanted to perform CRUD operations. Well, it is true. The point is DRF is for applications. The DRF has this special feature of browsable API.

Otherwise, you would have seen just the JSON response like this.

DRF makes it easier for us to debug their APIs. The other big feature of DRF is that it converts the Models into serializers. What we have done in this Django REST Framework tutorial is simply made classes and extended them with built-in classes.

If we needed to have this kind of architecture, we would need so much more code in place.

DRF made it so easy for us to serialize data.

The serializers not only take our models and transmit them as JSON objects. They also provide data from users to the backend. They automatically clean the data or validate data. This is a plus from DRF. Cleaned data removes all the security issues.

Believe me, the security provided by DRF is well established. Django REST Framework has many more features than explained here. They go well beyond the scope of just Django. You will need a better understanding of APIs and REST architecture. It is not so difficult but will take time.

## What else i wanna add in here ...ummm ?


Well, I can say that DRF is an amazing extension to Django. Django is capable on its own but DRF takes that one step ahead. Django’s rapid development is boosted by the use of DRF. Django Rest Framework has more features like Requests and response methods.

There is so much DRF is capable of and the same goes for all readers. DRF will let you communicate with various applications over the internet. The most prominent Django REST Framework examples are of Android Applications and Web apps. You will only have different UI/ UX. The backend will be Django.

API communication is handled by Django REST Framework. That’s how you can do full-stack development.
